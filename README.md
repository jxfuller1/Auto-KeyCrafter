Originally made this program to auto hit key combinations or auto cast keys when playing Last Epoch.  However, it could be used for any game.
Bonus is that some anti-cheats that pick up on Autohotkey, won't pick this up.


<b>How to use:</b>

For auto-hitting key combinations:  
Enter Hotkey, keys you would like it to hit and interval between key presses:

For auto-casting keys:
Select which key(s) you want, select interval between key presses, enter start/stop hotkey.  With optional choice to hold key and release at given interval instead of just pressing the key at the interval:

Update:  Added feature to autocasting keys to allow user to choose how long the key press should be held down before releasing.  This is because games such as Last Epoch require the key to be held down for X amount of time in order to register the key press, especially if you are casting another ability at the same time.

(should probably add this feature to the autohit keys tab as well instead of just the autocasting).

Feel free to hit me up for any questions or any features you would like this to have.

Sidenote:  Right now I have it hardcoded for only 5 possible selections for autocast or autohit keys, however, with the way i have this coded
I can easily add more by changing a single integer value or decide to make it completely user controlled to add or substract how many they want.
