Originally made this program to auto hit key combinations or auto cast keys when playing Last Epoch.  However, it could be used for any game.
Bonus is that some anti-cheats that pick up on Autohotkey, won't pick this up.


<b>How to use:</b>

For auto-hitting key combinations:  
Enter Hotkey, keys you would like it to hit and interval between key presses:

For auto-casting keys:
Select which key(s) you want, select interval between key presses, enter start/stop hotkey:
