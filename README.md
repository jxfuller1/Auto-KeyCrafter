Originally made this program to auto hit key combinations or auto cast keys when playing Last Epoch.  However, it could be used for any game.
Bonus is that some anti-cheats that pick up on Autohotkey, won't pick this up.


<b>How to use:</b>

For auto-hitting key combinations:  
Enter Hotkey, keys you would like it to hit and interval between key presses:

For auto-casting keys:
Select which key(s) you want, select interval between key presses, enter start/stop hotkey.  With optional choice to hold key and release at given interval instead of just pressing the key at the interval:

Feel free to hit me up for any questions or any features you would like this to have.

Sidenote:  Right now I have it hardcoded for only 5 possible selections for autocast or autohit keys, however, with the way i have this coded
I can easily add more by changing a single integer value or decide to make it completely user controlled to add or substract how many they want.
